* As a user, I want a page that displays relevant information for leagues I am interested in
- The user will see general league information such as previous/upcoming fixtures and latest league news.
- When the user hovers their mouse over the empty star icon (add to favotites) it jumps up and fills in.
- When the user clicks on the empty star icon, it remains filled and that player/team gets added to their favorites.
- When the user clicks on the solid star icon, it becomes empty and that player/team gets removed from their favorites.
